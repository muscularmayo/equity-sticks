this project was created using create-react-app

Equity-Sticks is for elementary school teachers who already use the physical "equity sticks", which are usually popsicle sticks with every student's name written on them - which can then be shuffled around to choose a student name randomly. This website/app is designed to be as fair, or equitable, as possible! This means we are keeping track of how many times each student has participated during the week and our pool of students to choose from is always going to be those with the lowest counts.

I made this app to explore lifecycle methods and to dive a little deeper into react. I think it helped me with architecture and figuring out where to put state and how to manipulate it all. Whenever I start a new project I'm always a bit lost, and this project helped me remember that I actually do know how to use react :)

Also, we use localStorage to store student names and their counts - and we build off localStorage when we first open the app.
